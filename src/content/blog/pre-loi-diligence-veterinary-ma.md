## The Problem with Post-LOI Diligence

In veterinary M&A, critical market intelligence often surfaces after Letters of Intent are submitted. By that point, deal momentum makes it difficult to walk away, even when red flags emerge.

## What Gets Missed Before LOI

### Talent Availability

Most investors assess staffing feasibility after the deal is signed. The questions that should be asked pre-LOI:

- How many licensed DVMs exist within realistic hiring distance?
- What is the competitive density for veterinary talent?
- Are there specialty credentialing requirements that limit the candidate pool?
- What is the historical turnover rate in this market?

### Competitive Saturation

Ownership consolidation is accelerating, but visibility into who owns what remains opaque. Shell LLCs and holding entities obscure true competitive dynamics.

Smart investors validate:

- Actual practice ownership structures in the target market
- Recent acquisitions and expansion activity
- Pricing pressure from corporate consolidation
- Market share concentration risks

### Market Dynamics

Geographic expansion looks attractive on paper, but reality surfaces in the data:

- Drive-time accessibility for clients and staff
- Demographic trends affecting pet ownership
- Practice density and revenue concentration
- Reputation signals from review platforms

## The Hidden Cost of Incomplete Inputs

When diligence happens too late, investors face:

- **Post-close staffing crises**: Discovering the talent pool is smaller than assumed
- **Unexpected competitive pressure**: Realizing consolidation has already saturated the market
- **Integration challenges**: Finding ownership structures don't match representations
- **Portfolio risk compounding**: Issues replicating across multiple geographies

## The Pre-LOI Intelligence Framework

VetPulse provides investors with decision-grade intelligence before capital is committed:

### 1. Workforce Validation

- Licensing data across all 50 states, normalized and verified
- Addressable talent pools mapped by location
- Competitive hiring pressure quantified

### 2. Ownership Clarity

- Practice-level ownership structures unmask shell entities
- Recent M&A activity tracked
- MSO consolidation mapped

### 3. Market Context

- Geospatial competition analysis at drive-time level
- Demographic overlays for growth assessment
- Reputation trends tracked over time

## Case Study: 400+ Location Corporate Group

A large veterinary corporate group engaged VetPulse to unify 125,000 licensed veterinarians into a single, validated dataset. The project included:

- Mapping addressable hiring markets per clinic location
- Identifying talent deserts where expansion would face structural challenges
- Integration directly into Greenhouse for recruiter access

Result: Portfolio-wide visibility into hiring feasibility before opening positions.

## The Strategic Advantage

Investors who validate market intelligence pre-LOI gain:

- **Pricing leverage**: Data-backed negotiation around talent availability
- **Risk mitigation**: Identification of markets to avoid
- **Faster integration**: Operational readiness from day one
- **Portfolio optimization**: Strategic decisions grounded in evidence

## The Bottom Line

Veterinary M&A is accelerating, but market intelligence infrastructure hasn't kept pace. The firms winning in this environment are those who validate assumptions before submitting LOIs—not after.

VetPulse exists to remove unknowns before they become liabilities.
